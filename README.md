# Cthulock
Cthulock is a screen locker for Wayland focused on customizability. You can style your lock screen using the [Slint](https://slint.dev/docs.html) language. An example config is already provided for you to build upon.

## Configuration
Copy the sample config into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cthulock` and start customizing it, for example by swapping out the wallpaper or moving the clock anywhere else. You can find the Slint syntax [here](https://slint.dev/docs.html).

For details on which properties and callbacks your Slint component needs to have look at the [configuration docs](./docs/configuration.md)

The wallpaper in the example configuration is "[Wallpaper](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131042142@N05/16252364850)" by [DyosEL](https://www.flickr.com/photos/131042142@N05) and is licensed under CC BY 2.0.
